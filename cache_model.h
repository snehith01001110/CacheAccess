// This is a simple c-based cache simulator which accumulates access time as it is queried
// by some externally generated addresses. It is a very simple direct mapped cache with variable
// cache line length, size and latencies. To simulate say, 100k reads to a random address, just
// initialize the model, set the cache mode (off or on), and then generate 100k calls to
// cm_do_access(<address>) choosing a new random address each time. You can get the accumulated
// time with the call (int) cm_get_last_access_cycles(), as often as you like. The result is
// cumulative.
